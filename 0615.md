## UNDERSTANDING CASH FLOW STATEMENTS

The cash flow statement provides information beyond that available from net income and other financial data. 

The cash flow statement provides information about a firm’s liquidity, solvency, and financial flexibility. The cash flow statement reconciles the beginning and ending balances of cash over an accounting period 

The change in cash is a result of the firm’s operating, investing, and financing activities as follows：

$$
Operating \; activities + Investing \; activities + Financing \; activities = Change \; in \; cash \; balance \; sheet + Beginning \; cash \; balance = Ending \; cash \; balance  
$$

The formula mentioned above is the US.GAAP Cash Flow Classification

- Interest and dividends received may be classified as either CFO or CFI. 

- Dividends paid to shareholders and interest paid on debt may be classified as either CFO or CFF. 

- Income taxes are reported as operating activities unless the expense can be tied to an investing or financing transaction

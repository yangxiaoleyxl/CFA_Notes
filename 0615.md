## UNDERSTANDING CASH FLOW STATEMENTS

The cash flow statement provides information beyond that available from net income and other financial data. 

The cash flow statement provides information about a firm’s liquidity, solvency, and financial flexibility. The cash flow statement reconciles the beginning and ending balances of cash over an accounting period 

The change in cash is a result of the firm’s operating, investing, and financing activities as follows：

$$
Operating \; activities + Investing \; activities + Financing \; activities = Change \; in \; cash \; balance \; sheet + Beginning \; cash \; balance = Ending \; cash \; balance  
$$

The formula mentioned above is the US.GAAP Cash Flow Classification 

### Differences Between U.S. GAAP and IFRS  

Under IFRS:

- Interest and dividends received may be classified as either CFO or CFI. 

- Dividends paid to shareholders and interest paid on debt may be classified as either CFO or CFF. 

- Income taxes are reported as operating activities unless the expense can be tied to an investing or financing transaction      

Direct Method and Indirect Methods Calculating CFO  

Two different methods of presenting the cash flow statement are permitted under U.S. GAAP and IFRS: the direct method and the indirect method.  
- Direct Method ： 
    - Cash collected from sales is the main component of CFO. Cash collections are calculated by adjusting sales for the changes in accounts receivable and unearned (deferred) revenue.
    - Cash used in the production of goods and services (cash inputs) is calculated by adjusting cost of goods sold (COGS) for the changes in inventory and accounts payable

- Indirect Method 
    Using the indirect method, operating cash flow is calculated in four steps: Step 1: Begin with net income.  
    - Step1 : Begin with net income 
    - Step2 : Add or subtract changes to related balance sheet operating accounts as follows  
        - Increases in the operating asset accounts (uses of cash) are subtracted, while decreases (sources of cash) are added 
        - Increases in the operating liability accounts (sources of cash) are added, while decreases (uses of cash) are subtracted  
    - Step3 : Add back all noncash charges to income (such as depreciation and amortization) and subtract all noncash components of revenue  
    - Step4 : Subtract gains or add losses that resulted from financing or investing cash flows (such as gains from sale of land)  

### Disclosure Requirements 
Under U.S. GAAP, a direct method presentation must also disclose the adjustments necessary to reconcile net income to cash flow from operating activities. The reconciliation is not required under IFRS. 

Under IFRS, payments for interest and taxes must be disclosed separately in the cash flow statement under either method (direct or indirect). Under U.S. GAAP, payments for interest and taxes can be reported in the cash flow statement or disclosed in the footnotes 

### Investing and Financing Cash Flows 

**Investing cash flows (CFI)** are calculated by subtracting expenditures on new assets from the proceeds of asset sales  

Financing cash flows (CFF) are determined by measuring the cash flows occurring between the firm and its suppliers of capital. Cash flows between the firm and creditors result from new borrowings and debt repayments 

### Analysis of the Cash Flow Statement

The cash flow statement can be converted to common-size format by expressing each line item as a percentage of revenue 

**Free cash flow** is a measure of cash that is available for discretionary purposes; that is, the cash flow that is available once the firm has covered its obligations and capital expenditures 

**Free cash flow to the firm (FCFF)** is the cash available to all investors, including stockholders and debt holders. FCFF can be calculated using net income or operating cash flow as a starting point 

**Free cash flow to equity (FCFE)** is the cash flow that is available for distribution to the common shareholders; that is, after all obligations have been paid. FCFE can be calculated as follows

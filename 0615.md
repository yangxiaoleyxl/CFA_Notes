## UNDERSTANDING CASH FLOW STATEMENTS

The cash flow statement provides information beyond that available from net income and other financial data. 

The cash flow statement provides information about a firm’s liquidity, solvency, and financial flexibility. The cash flow statement reconciles the beginning and ending balances of cash over an accounting period 

The change in cash is a result of the firm’s operating, investing, and financing activities as follows：

$$
Operating \; activities + Investing \; activities + Financing \; activities = Change \; in \; cash \; balance \; sheet + Beginning \; cash \; balance = Ending \; cash \; balance  
$$

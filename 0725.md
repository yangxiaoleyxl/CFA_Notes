### INVENTORIES 
For a manufacturing firm, raw materials, goods in process, and finished goods are recorded on the balance sheet as a current asset called inventory 

Costs included:
- Purchase cost 
- Conversion cost 
- Allocation of fixed production overhead based on normal capacity levels 
- Other costs necessary to bring the inventory to its present location and condition 

With **standard costing**, unit cost is based on predetermined amounts of materials, labor, and overhead 

ith the **retail method**, unit costs are calculated as retail prices less gross profit margin  

### Inventory Cost Allocation Methods 
The cost of goods sold during a period can be accounted for using one of several methods, referred to as **cost flow methods** 

First-in, first-out (FIFO) assumes costs incurred for items that are purchased or manufactured first are the first costs to enter the cost of goods sold (COGS) computation.  

Last-in, first-out (LIFO) assumes costs incurred for items that are purchased or manufactured most recently are the first costs to enter the COGS computation.  

Weighted average costing calculates an average cost per unit by dividing cost of goods available by total units available. This average cost is used to determine both COGS and ending inventory 

### Inventory Values on the Balance Sheet 
Under IFRS, inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which is estimated sales proceeds net of direct selling costs 

Under U.S. GAAP, firms that use LIFO or the retail method value inventories at the lower of cost or market 

### Periodic and Perpetual Inventory Systems 
In a **periodic inventory** system, inventory values and COGS are determined at the end of the accounting period 

In a **perpetual inventory** system, inventory values and COGS are updated continuously

### INVENTORIES 
For a manufacturing firm, raw materials, goods in process, and finished goods are recorded on the balance sheet as a current asset called inventory 

Costs included:
- Purchase cost 
- Conversion cost 
- Allocation of fixed production overhead based on normal capacity levels 
- Other costs necessary to bring the inventory to its present location and condition 

With **standard costing**, unit cost is based on predetermined amounts of materials, labor, and overhead 

ith the **retail method**, unit costs are calculated as retail prices less gross profit margin

### INVENTORIES 
For a manufacturing firm, raw materials, goods in process, and finished goods are recorded on the balance sheet as a current asset called inventory 

Costs included:
- Purchase cost 
- Conversion cost 
- Allocation of fixed production overhead based on normal capacity levels 
- Other costs necessary to bring the inventory to its present location and condition 

With **standard costing**, unit cost is based on predetermined amounts of materials, labor, and overhead 

ith the **retail method**, unit costs are calculated as retail prices less gross profit margin  

### Inventory Cost Allocation Methods 
The cost of goods sold during a period can be accounted for using one of several methods, referred to as **cost flow methods** 

First-in, first-out (FIFO) assumes costs incurred for items that are purchased or manufactured first are the first costs to enter the cost of goods sold (COGS) computation.  

Last-in, first-out (LIFO) assumes costs incurred for items that are purchased or manufactured most recently are the first costs to enter the COGS computation.  

Weighted average costing calculates an average cost per unit by dividing cost of goods available by total units available. This average cost is used to determine both COGS and ending inventory 

### Inventory Values on the Balance Sheet 
Under IFRS, inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which is estimated sales proceeds net of direct selling costs 

Under U.S. GAAP, firms that use LIFO or the retail method value inventories at the lower of cost or market 

### Periodic and Perpetual Inventory Systems 
In a **periodic inventory** system, inventory values and COGS are determined at the end of the accounting period 

In a **perpetual inventory** system, inventory values and COGS are updated continuously 

### LIFO vs. FIFO 
- LIFO results in : 
    - Higher COGS 
    - Lower gross profit 
    - Lower inventory balances 
- FIFO results in:
    - Lower COGS 
    - Higher gross profit 
    - Higher inventory balances   

### LIFO Reserve 
Firms that report under LIFO must report a **LIFO reserve**, the amount by which LIFO inventory is less than FIFO inventory 

### LIFO Liquidation
A **LIFO liquidation** occurs when a LIFO firm’s inventory quantities decline

### Ratios for Evaluating Inventory Management  
Ratios that are directly affected by the choice of inventory accounting method include inventory turnover, days of inventory, and gross profit margin  
- High inventory turnover relative to other firms in an industry may indicate too little inventory and low turnover may indicate inventory that is too great 
- Comparing the firm’s revenue growth to that of the industry can provide information on whether inventories are too large or too small  

### Ratios and Inventory Method 
- Profitability. LIFO produces higher COGS in the income statement and will result in lower earning. Any profitability measure that includes COGS will be lower under LIFO. 
- Liquidity. LIFO results in a lower inventory value on the balance sheet. 
- Activity. Inventory turnover (COGS / average inventory) is higher for firms that use LIFO compared to firms that use FIFO  
- Solvency. LIFO results in lower total assets compared to FIFO because LIFO inventory is lower 

### LONG-LIVED ASSETS 
The purchase cost of assets that will provide economic benefits to the firm over more than one year is typically not taken as an expense in the year of acquisition, but is capitalized (creating an asset on the balance sheet) and spread over an asset’s useful economic life by recording depreciation of the asset’s value。 

- Capitalization of interest 

### Internally Created Intangible 
For internally generated intangible assets, firms reporting under IFRS must expense research costs as incurred but may capitalize development costs (costs incurred after technological feasibility and the intent to use or sell the completed asset have been established) 

### Depreciation 
The historical cost of capitalized physical assets is allocated over their economic (useful) lives by recording depreciation expense. Depreciation methods include straight-line (an equal amount each period), accelerated (greater in the early years of an asset’s life), and units-of-production (proportional to asset use) 
- straight-line deprecation 
- Double-declining balance (an accelerated method) 

**Units of production and service hours depreciation**. Under this method, an asset’s depreciable basis is divided by estimated units of production or total service hours.

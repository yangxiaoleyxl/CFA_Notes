## Income Statement 
- **Potentially dilutive securities**  . These securities include stock options, warrants, convertible debt, and convertible preferred stock  
- **Dilutive securities**. Those securities that would decrease EPS if exercised and converted to common stock  
- **Antidilutive securities**. Those securities that would increase EPS if exercised and converted to common stock  
- **Simple capital structure**. A capital structure that contains no potentially dilutive securities. This structure contains only common stock, nonconvertible debt, and nonconvertible preferred stock 
- **Complex capital structures**. Complex structures contain potentially dilutive securities such as options, warrants, or convertible securities 
- **Weighted average number of shares outstanding**. Each share issue is weighted by the portion of the year it was outstanding. Stock splits and stock dividends are applied retroactively to the beginning of the year, so “old” shares are converted to “new” shares for consistency  

### Basic EPS 
The basic EPS calculation does not consider the effects of any dilutive securities in the computation of EPS. It is the only EPS presented for firms with simple capital structures and is one of the two EPS calculations presented for firms with complex capital structures。 

$$ Basic EPS = \frac{net \: income - preferred \: dividends}{ weighted \; average \; number \; of \; share \; outstanding } $$ 

### Diluted EPS 
If a firm has a complex capital structure (contains potentially dilutive securities), both basic and diluted EPS must be reported. To calculate diluted EPS, treat any dilutive securities as if they were converted to common stock from the first of the year (or when issued if issued during the current year) 

Each potentially dilutive security must be considered separately to determine whether or not it is actually dilutive for the current reporting period. Only income from **continuing operations (excluding discontinued operations and accounting changes)** is considered in determining diluted EPS 

To determine **whether a convertible security is dilutive**, calculate 
$$ \frac{convertible \; pfd. \; dividends}{ \# shares \; from \; conversion \; of \;  pdf. } $$ 

$$ \frac{convertible \; debt \; interest \; (1- tax \; rate) }{ \# shares \; from \; conversion \; of \; debt } $$   

If the calculated amount is <font color="red"> less than basic EPS </font>, the security is dilutive. 

When considering dilutive securities, the denominator is the basic EPS denominator
adjusted for the equivalent number of common shares created by the conversion of all outstanding dilutive securities ( <font color="red"> convertible bonds, convertible preferred shares, plus options and warrants </font> )

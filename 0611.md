## BALANCE SHEETS  
<!-- <font color="red">  </font> -->

The <font color="red"> The balance sheet shows the values of the assets and liabilities of the firm at a point in time </font> . Balance sheet items can be divided into **assets**, **liabilities**, and **equity**   
$$
assets = liabilities + owner's \; equity
$$ 
- A **classified balance sheet** groups together similar items (current assets, current liabilities, current liabilities, noncurrent liabilities) to arrive at significant subtotals. 
- Under IFRS, a **liquidity-based presentation** may be used if it is more relevant and reliable, as for a financial institution 

### Actual Process
The accrual method of accounting creates assets and liabilities 
- Cash received in advance of recognizing revenue results in an increase in assets (cash) and an increase in liabilities (unearned revenue). 
- Recognizing revenue before cash is received results in an increase in assets (accounts receivable) and an increase in equity (retained earnings). Cash paid in advance of recognizing expense results in a decrease in one asset (cash) and an increase in another asset (prepaid expenses) by the same amount. 
- Recognizing an expense before cash is paid results in an increase in liabilities (accrued expenses) and a decrease in equity (retained earnings)

### Current and Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities 
**Current assets** include cash and other assets that will be converted into cash or used up within one year or operating cycle, whichever is greater. 

**Current liabilities** are obligations that will be satisfied within one year or operating cycle, whichever is greater. More specifically, a liability that meets any of the following criteria is considered current:  
- Settlement is expected during the normal operating cycle. 
- It is held for trading purposes. 
- Settlement is expected within one year. 
- There is no unconditional right to defer settlement for at least one year 

### Current assets minus current liabilities equals **working capital**.
- **Noncurrent assets** do not meet the definition of current assets; that is, they will not be converted into cash or used up within one year or operating cycle. 
- **Noncurrent liabilities** do not meet the criteria of current liabilities.
If a firm includes (consolidates) balance sheet accounts of a subsidiary that is not 100% owned, the firm reports a **noncontrolling interest** or **minority interest** in its consolidated balance sheet. The noncontrolling interest is the pro-rata share of the subsidiary’s net assets (equity) not owned by the parent company. Noncontrolling interest is reported in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet

### Measurement Bases of Assets and Liabilities 
Balance sheet assets and liabilities are valued using both 
- historical cost: It was exchanged at the acquisition date 
- fair value : The amount at which an asset could be sold, or a liability transferred, in an orderly transaction between willing parties 

**Common current assets** are: 
- *Cash, and cash equivalents*: cash equivalents typically mature in 90 days or less (e.g., 90-day T-bills).
- *Accounts receivable (trade receivables)*: receivables are reported net of any allowance for bad debt. 
- *Inventories*: items held for sale or used in the manufacture of goods to be sold. - Firms that use the retail method measure inventory at retail prices and subtract an expected gross margin to reflect cost 
- *Marketable securities* — debt or equity securities that are traded in a public market. Other current assets—includes prepaid expenses. Some examples of current liabilities are: Accounts payable (trade payables)—amounts owed to suppliers. 
- *Notes payable* — obligations in the form of promissory notes due to creditors within one year or operating cycle, whichever is greater. 
- *Current portion of long-term debt* — the principal portion of debt due within one year or operating cycle, whichever is greater. 
- *Taxes payable* — current taxes that have been recognized in the income statement but have not yet been paid. 
- *Accrued liabilities (accrued expenses)* — expenses that have been recognized in the income statement but are not yet contractually due. 
- *Unearned revenue (income)* — cash collected in advance of providing goods and services. The related liability is to provide those goods and services   

**Tangible assets** 
- *Long-term assets with physical substance* are known as tangible assets. Tangible assets, such as plant, equipment natural resources and even land. Under IFRS, tangible assets held for capital appreciation or to earn rental income are classified as **investment property** 

<!-- **Intangible assets**
- *Intangible assets* are long-term assets that lack physical substance. Examples of identifiable intangible assets include patents, trademarks, and copyrights. 

- *Goodwill* is created when a business is purchased for more than the fair value of its assets net of liabilities. Goodwill is not amortized, but must be tested for impairment (a decrease in its fair value) at least annually 

When computing ratios, analysts should eliminate goodwill from the balance sheet and goodwill impairment charges from the income statement for comparability. Intangible assets that are purchased are reported on the balance sheet at historical cost less accumulated amortization. Except for certain legal costs, intangible assets that arecreated internally, including research and development costs, are expensed as incurred under U.S. GAAP and are not shown on the balance sheet. 

Under IFRS, a firm must identify the research stage and the development stage. Accordingly, the firm must expense costs during the research stage but may capitalize costs incurred during the development stage  -->

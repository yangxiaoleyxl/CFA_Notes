## BALANCE SHEETS  
<!-- <font color="red">  </font> -->

The <font color="red"> The balance sheet shows the values of the assets and liabilities of the firm at a point in time </font> . Balance sheet items can be divided into **assets**, **liabilities**, and **equity**   
$$
assets = liabilities + owner's \; equity
$$ 
- A **classified balance sheet** groups together similar items (current assets, current liabilities, current liabilities, noncurrent liabilities) to arrive at significant subtotals. 
- Under IFRS, a **liquidity-based presentation** may be used if it is more relevant and reliable, as for a financial institution 

### Actual Process
The accrual method of accounting creates assets and liabilities 
- Cash received in advance of recognizing revenue results in an increase in assets (cash) and an increase in liabilities (unearned revenue). 
- Recognizing revenue before cash is received results in an increase in assets (accounts receivable) and an increase in equity (retained earnings). Cash paid in advance of recognizing expense results in a decrease in one asset (cash) and an increase in another asset (prepaid expenses) by the same amount. 
- Recognizing an expense before cash is paid results in an increase in liabilities (accrued expenses) and a decrease in equity (retained earnings)

### Current and Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities 
**Current assets** include cash and other assets that will be converted into cash or used up within one year or operating cycle, whichever is greater. 

**Current liabilities** are obligations that will be satisfied within one year or operating cycle, whichever is greater. More specifically, a liability that meets any of the following criteria is considered current:  
- Settlement is expected during the normal operating cycle. 
- It is held for trading purposes. 
- Settlement is expected within one year. 
- There is no unconditional right to defer settlement for at least one year 

### Current assets minus current liabilities equals **working capital**.
- **Noncurrent assets** do not meet the definition of current assets; that is, they will not be converted into cash or used up within one year or operating cycle. 
- **Noncurrent liabilities** do not meet the criteria of current liabilities.
If a firm includes (consolidates) balance sheet accounts of a subsidiary that is not 100% owned, the firm reports a **noncontrolling interest** or **minority interest** in its consolidated balance sheet. The noncontrolling interest is the pro-rata share of the subsidiary’s net assets (equity) not owned by the parent company. Noncontrolling interest is reported in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet

### Measurement Bases of Assets and Liabilities 
Balance sheet assets and liabilities are valued using both 
- historical cost: It was exchanged at the acquisition date 
- fair value : The amount at which an asset could be sold, or a liability transferred, in an orderly transaction between willing parties 

**Common current assets** are: 
- *Cash, and cash equivalents*: cash equivalents typically mature in 90 days or less (e.g., 90-day T-bills).
- *Accounts receivable (trade receivables)*: receivables are reported net of any allowance for bad debt. 
- *Inventories*: items held for sale or used in the manufacture of goods to be sold. - Firms that use the retail method measure inventory at retail prices and subtract an expected gross margin to reflect cost 
- *Marketable securities* — debt or equity securities that are traded in a public market. Other current assets—includes prepaid expenses. Some examples of current liabilities are: Accounts payable (trade payables)—amounts owed to suppliers. 
- *Notes payable* — obligations in the form of promissory notes due to creditors within one year or operating cycle, whichever is greater. 
- *Current portion of long-term debt* — the principal portion of debt due within one year or operating cycle, whichever is greater. 
- *Taxes payable* — current taxes that have been recognized in the income statement but have not yet been paid. 
- *Accrued liabilities (accrued expenses)* — expenses that have been recognized in the income statement but are not yet contractually due. 
- *Unearned revenue (income)* — cash collected in advance of providing goods and services. The related liability is to provide those goods and services

## Financial Ratios Based on the Income Statement 
- A vertical **common-size income statement** expresses all income statement items as a percentage of sales. This format is useful for time-series and cross-sectional analysis and facilitates the comparison of firms of different sizes. 
- It is usually more meaningful to present income tax expense as an effective rate, equal to income tax expense divided by pre-tax income, than as a percentage of sales. 
- **Profitability ratios** examine how well management has done at generating profits from sales. The different ratios are designed to isolate specific costs. Generally, higher margin ratios are desirable. 
- **Gross profit margin** is the ratio of gross profit (sales less cost of goods sold) to sales 
$$ gross \; profit \; margin = \frac{gross \; profit }{revenue} $$ 
Gross profit margin can be increased by **raising sales prices** or **lowering per-unit cost**

- **Net profit margin** is the ratio of net income to sales 
$$ net \; profit \; margin = \frac{net \; income }{revenue} $$ 

Net profit margin can be increased by raising sales prices or cutting costs  

## Items Excluded from the Income Statement that Affect Owners’ Equity 
- Transactions with owners: 
    - Issuing or reacquiring stock 
    - Dividends paid 

- Transactions included in other comprehensive income
    - 1. Foreign currency translation gains and losses. 
    - 2. Adjustments for minimum pension liability. 
    - 3. Unrealized gains and losses from cash flow hedging derivatives.  
    - 4. Unrealized gains and losses from available-for-sale securities (U.S. GAAP) or securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (IFRS). 

<font color="red"> Comprehensive income </font> is a measure that includes all changes to equity other than owner contributions and distributions  -->

## Treasury Stock Method  
<!-- <font color="red">  </font> -->

The <font color="red"> treasury stock </font> method assumes that the hypothetical funds received by the company from the exercise of options or warrants are used to purchase shares of the company’s common stock at the average market price over the reporting period 

Options and warrants are dilutive whenever the exercise price is less than the average stock price over the reporting period 

## Financial Ratios Based on the Income Statement 
- A vertical **common-size income statement** expresses all income statement items as a percentage of sales. This format is useful for time-series and cross-sectional analysis and facilitates the comparison of firms of different sizes. 
- It is usually more meaningful to present income tax expense as an effective rate, equal to income tax expense divided by pre-tax income, than as a percentage of sales. 
- **Profitability ratios** examine how well management has done at generating profits from sales. The different ratios are designed to isolate specific costs. Generally, higher margin ratios are desirable. 
- **Gross profit margin** is the ratio of gross profit (sales less cost of goods sold) to sales 
$$ gross \; profit \; margin = \frac{gross \; profit }{revenue} $$ 
Gross profit margin can be increased by **raising sales prices** or **lowering per-unit cost**

- **Net profit margin** is the ratio of net income to sales 
$$ net \; profit \; margin = \frac{net \; income }{revenue} $$ 

Net profit margin can be increased by raising sales prices or cutting costs

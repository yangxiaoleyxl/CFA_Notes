## FINANCIAL ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES 
With respect to analysis of financial statements, there are a number of key ratios that should simply be memorized including:

- Current, quick, and cash ratios.
- All the ratios in the cash conversion cycle (the turnover ratios are more important, like receivables, inventory, and payables turnover). 
- Turnover ratios use sales in the numerator, except for payables and inventory turnover ratios, which use purchases and COGS, respectively. 
- Gross profit margin, net profit margin, and operating profit margin are readily available from a common-size income statement. 
- Return on equity (ROE) is critical. Definitely know the three- and five-component DuPont ROE decompositions. 
- Debt-to-equity, total debt, interest coverage, and fixed financial coverage ratios (remember to add lease interest expense to numerator and denominator). 
- The retention ratio and growth rate are important concepts that also appear in Corporate Finance and Equity Investments.
